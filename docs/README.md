## üìù Maintenance

### When to update docs

- ‚úÖ Add new features ‚Üí update related technical docs
- ‚úÖ Architecture changes ‚Üí update ARCHITECTURE.md
- ‚úÖ Deployment process changes ‚Üí update DEPLOYMENT.md
- ‚úÖ Found documentation errors ‚Üí fix immediately

### Writing guidelines

1. **Use clear heading levels**
   - H1 (`#`) - Document title
   - H2 (`##`) - Main sections
   - H3 (`###`) - Subsections

2. **Provide code examples**

   ```typescript
   // Good docs include runnable examples
   const example = 'like this';
   ```

3. **Use tables and lists**
   - Easy to scan
   - Improves readability

4. **Add links**
   - Cross‚Äëreference related docs
   - Link to external resources
